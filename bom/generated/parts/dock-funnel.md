- Part ID: `dock-funnel`
- Unit: each
- Kind: component
- Lifecycle: active
- Disciplines: mechanical
- Traits: fabricated, printed

## Requirements

- Approx. 250–300 mm approach opening guiding the pod toward the separate locating nest; dock capture at ~2.65–2.70 m.

## Used in

Quantities are per assembly definition, before build multipliers. Optional and deferred usages are shown even when excluded from a scenario. Procurement stock is not an installed physical owner.

## BOM reports

- [ARBI V1 — Zagreb repository baseline](../arbi-v1-hr-zagreb.md#required-parts-by-physical-owner-or-procurement-bucket) — included.

## Fabrication

- Process: openscad
- Model status: concept-unvalidated
- [hardware/assemblies/dock/dock-funnel.scad](../../../hardware/assemblies/dock/dock-funnel.scad) — module `dock_funnel`; revision 0.1.0.

### Print material estimate

Build arbi-v1; batch represents 1 BOM unit(s). One dock capture funnel. Latch hardware and weather hood remain separate unresolved fabrication costs.

Material consumption at observed 10+ mixed eligible 1 kg filament-with-spool bulk rates for PLA Basic, PETG Basic and PETG Matte. The shared Bambu EU mix-and-match basket must contain at least 10 eligible rolls; this is a conditional estimate, not an order or whole-roll procurement total. ASA has no evidenced eligible bulk rate and retains its single-spool price. PETG Matte White/Black is selected only for cosmetic shell surfaces; functional parts retain existing material assumptions. EU displayed VAT may change at Croatian checkout; shipping, supports, purge, failed prints, energy, machine time and labour are unknown. Solid CAD volume represents fully dense plastic, not slicer infill or measured weight.

Catalog lifecycle, procurement, and generated documentation do not establish physical validation. See the owning assembly for evidence and acceptance requirements.
