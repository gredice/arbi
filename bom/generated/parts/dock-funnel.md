- Part ID: `dock-funnel`
- Unit: each
- Kind: component
- Lifecycle: active
- Disciplines: mechanical
- Traits: fabricated, printed

## Requirements

- Approx. 250–300 mm approach opening guiding the pod toward the separate locating nest; dock capture at ~2.65–2.70 m.

## Used in

Quantities are per assembly definition, before build multipliers. Optional and deferred usages are shown even when excluded from a scenario. Procurement stock is not an installed physical owner.

| Assembly or purchasing bucket | Quantity | Inclusion | Usage note |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| [Dock](../../../docs/assemblies/dock/README.md) | 1 each | base | — |

## BOM reports

- [ARBI V1 — Zagreb repository baseline](../arbi-v1-hr-zagreb.md#required-parts-by-physical-owner-or-procurement-bucket) — included.

## Fabrication

- Process: openscad
- Model status: concept-unvalidated
- [hardware/assemblies/dock/dock-funnel.scad](../../../hardware/assemblies/dock/dock-funnel.scad) — module `dock_funnel`; revision 0.1.0.

### Print material estimate

Build arbi-v1; batch represents 1 BOM unit(s). One dock capture funnel. Latch hardware and weather hood remain separate unresolved fabrication costs.

Volume evidence: [cad-v0.1.4](https://github.com/gredice/arbi/releases/tag/cad-v0.1.4); [canonical recipes, mesh checksums and source hashes](../../catalog/fabrication.json).

Material consumption only at single 1 kg filament-with-spool MSRP; bulk discounts excluded. EU displayed VAT may change at Croatian checkout; shipping, supports, purge, failed prints, energy, machine time and labour are unknown. PETG is a prototype costing assumption; ASA is used for exposed cover recipes. Solid CAD volume represents fully dense plastic, not slicer infill or measured weight.

Catalog lifecycle, procurement, and generated documentation do not establish physical validation. See the owning assembly for evidence and acceptance requirements.
